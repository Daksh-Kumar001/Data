    "# Answer 1 - String slicing is a method in Python to access a specific part or \"slice\" of a string.\n",
    "# It’s done by specifying a range of indices within square brackets, [start:end:step], where start is \n",
    "# the beginning index, end is the stopping index (not included in the slice), and step determines the\n",
    "# interval of characters selected. String slicing is useful for tasks like extracting specific data\n",
    "# segments, reversing strings, or checking for palindromes.\n",

    "# str = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
